This repository is organized in such a way that it can be place in some common
location such as /opt and then symlinked into tftp and web space.

Example:

    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/foolean/pxe
    ln -s /opt/pxe/tftp /srv/tftp
    ln -s /opt/pxe/www  /var/www/html/install

The various netboot images can be downloaded once the basic structure is
established.
